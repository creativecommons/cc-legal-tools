# Creative Commons Licenses


## Licenses and Public Domain Declarations

The project title, *Creative Commons Licenses*, has been shortened for
convenience. This project also includes the Public Domain declarations.


## Not the live site

This project is not intended to serve the license and deed pages directly.
Though if it's deployed on a public server it could do that, performance would
probably not be acceptable.

Instead, a command line tool can be used to save all the rendered HTML pages
for licenses and deeds as files. Then those files are used as part of the real
creativecommons.org site, just served as static files. See details farther
down.

For the parent project for the entire creativecommons.org site (of which this
project is a component, see
[creativecommons/project_creativecommons.org][project_cc].

[project_cc]: https://github.com/creativecommons/project_creativecommons.org


## Software Versions

- [Python 3.7][python37] (For parity with Debian GNU/Linux 10 [buster])
- [Django 3.2][django32]

Both versions are specified in the [`Pipfile`](Pipefile).

[python37]: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
[django32]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/


## Setting up the Project


### Data Repository

The [creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata] project repository should be
cloned into a directory adjacent to this one:
```
PARENT_DIR
├── cc-licenses
└── cc-licenses-data
```

If it is not cloned into the default location,  the Django
`DATA_REPOSITORY_DIR` django configuration setting, or the
`DATA_REPOSITORY_DIR` environment variable can be used to configure its
location.

[repodata]:https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-licenses-data


### Docker Compose Setup

Use the following instructions to start the project with Docker compose.

1. Initial Setup
   1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above,  is in place
   2. Install Docker ([Install Docker Engine | Docker
      Documentation][installdocker])
   3. Create Django local settings file
        ```
        cp cc_licenses/settings/local.example.py cc_licenses/settings/local.py
        ```
   4. Build the containers
        ```
        docker-compose build
        ```
   5. Run the containers
        ```
        docker-compose up
        ```
   6. Run database migrations
        ```
        docker-compose exec app ./manage.py migrate
        ```
   7. Clear data in the database
        ```
        docker-compose exec app ./manage.py clear_license_data
        ```
   8. Load legacy HTML in the database
        ```
        docker-compose exec app ./manage.py load_html_files
        ```

The commands above will create 3 docker containers:
1. **app** ([127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)): this Djano application
   - Any changes made to Python will be detected and rebuilt transparently as
     long as the development server is running.
2. **db**: PostgreSQL database backend for this Django application
3. **static** ([127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)): a static web server
   serving [creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata]/docs.

#### Helper Scripts

Best run before every commit:
- `./dev/coverage.sh` - Run coverage tests and report
- `./dev/tools.sh` - Run Python code tools (isort, black, flake8)

Esoteric and dangerous:
- `./dev/concatenatemessages.sh` - Concatenate legacy ccEngine translations
  into cc-licenses
  - rarely used (only after source strings are updated)
- `./dev/resetdb.sh` - Reset Django application database data (!!DANGER!!)
  - usually only helpful if you're doing model/schema work
- `./dev/updatemessages.sh` - Run Django Management nofuzzy_makemessages with
  helpful options (including excluding legalcode) and compilemessages


#### Coverage Tests and Report

The coverage tests and report are run as part of pre-commit and as a GitHub
Action. To run it manually:
1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above,  is in place
2. Ensure [Docker Compose Setup](#docker-compose-setup), above,  is complete
2. Coverage test
    ```
    docker-compose exec app coverage run manage.py test --noinput --keepdb
    ```
3. Coverage report
    ```
    docker-compose exec app coverage report
    ```


### Commit Errors


#### Error building trees

If you encounter an `error: Error building trees` error from pre-commit when
you commit, try adding your files (`git add <FILES>`) prior to committing them.


## Data

The license metadata is in a database. The metadata tracks which licenses
exist, their translations, their ports, and their characteristics like what
they permit, require, and prohibit.

The metadata can be downloaded by visiting URL path:
`127.0.0.1:8000`[`/licenses/metadata.yaml`][metadata]

[metadata]: http://127.0.0.1:8000/licenses/metadata.yaml

There are two main models (Django terminology for tables) in
[`licenses/models.py`](licenses/models.py):
1. `LegalCode`
2. `Licenses`

A License can be identified by a `unit` (ex. `by`, `by-nc-sa`, `devnations`)
which is a proxy for the complete set of permissions, requirements, and
prohibitions; a `version` (ex. `4.0`, `3.0)`, and an optional `jurisdiction`
for ports. So we might refer to the license by it's **identifier** "BY 3.0 AM"
which would be the 3.0 version of the BY license terms as ported to the Armenia
jurisdiction. For additional information see: [**Legal Tools Namespace** -
creativecommons/cc-licenses-data: CC Licenses data (static HTML, language
files, etc.)][namespace].

There are three places legal code text could be:
1. **gettext files** (`.po` and `.mo`) in the
   [creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata] repository (legal tools with
   full translation support):
   - 4.0 Licenses
   - CC0
2. **django template**
   ([`legalcode_licenses_3.0_unported.html`][unportedtemplate]):
   - Unported 3.0 Licenses (English-only)
3. **`html` field** (in the `LegalCode` model):
   - Everything else

The text that's in gettext files can be translated via Transifex at [Creative
Commons localization][cctransifex]. For additional information the Django
translation domains / Transifex resources, see [How the license translation is
implemented](#how-the-license-translation-is-implemented), below.

## Importing the existing license text

The process of getting the text into the site varies by license.

Note that once the site is up and running in production, the data in the site
will become the canonical source, and the process described here should not
need to be repeated after that.

The implementation is the Django management command `load_html_files`, which
reads from the legacy HTML legal code files in the
[creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata] repository, and populates the
database records and translation files.

`load_html_files` uses [BeautifulSoup4][bs4docs] to parse the legacy HTML legal
code:
1. `import_zero_license_html` for CC0 Public Domain tool
   - HTML is handled specificially (using tag ids and classes) to populate
     translation strings and to be used with specific HTML formatting when
     displayed via template
2. `import_by_40_license_html` for 4.0 License tools
   - HTML is handled specificially (using tag ids and classes) to populate
     translation strings and to be used with specific HTML formatting when
     displayed via a template
3. `import_by_30_unported_license_html` for unported 3.0 License tools
   (English-only)
   - HTML is handled specificially to be used with specific HTML formatting
     when displayed via a template
4. `simple_import_license_html` for everything else
   - HTML is handled generically; only the title and license body are
     identified. The body is stored in the `html` field of the
     `LegalCode` model

[bs4docs]: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
[repodata]: https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-licenses-data


### Import Process

This process will read the HTML files from the specified directory, populate
`LegalCode` and `License` models, and create `.po` files in
[creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata].

1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above, is in place
2. Ensure [Docker Compose Setup](#docker-compose-setup), above, is complete
3. Clear data in the database
    ```
    docker-compose exec app ./manage.py clear_license_data
    ```
4. Load legacy HTML in the database
    ```
    docker-compose exec app ./manage.py load_html_files
    ```
5. Optionally (and only as appropriate):
   1. commit `.po` file changes in [creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata]
   2. [Translation Update Process](#translation-update-process), below
   3. [Generate Static Files](#generate-static-files), below

## Translation

To upload/download translation files to/from Transifex, you'll need an account
there with access to these translations. Then follow the [Authentication -
Transifex API v3][transauth]: to get an API token, and set
`TRANSIFEX["API_TOKEN"]` in your environment with its value.

The [creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata] repository must be cloned
next to this `cc-licenses` repository. (It can be elsewhere, then you need to
set `DATA_REPOSITORY_DIR` to its location.) Be sure to clone using a URL that
starts with `git@github...` and not `https://github...`, or you won't be able
to push to it. Also see [Data Repository](#data-repository), above.

In production, the `check_for_translation_updates` management command should be
run hourly. See [Check for Translation
Updates](#check-for-translation-updates), below.

Also see [Publishing changes to git repo](#publishing-changes-to-git-repo),
below.

[Babel][babel] is used for localization information.

### How the license translation is implemented

Django Translation uses two sets of Gettext Files in the
[creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata] repository (the [Data
Repository](#data-repository), above). See that repository for detailed
information and definitions.

- [Translation | Django documentation | Django][djangotranslation]
- Transifex API

### Check for Translation Updates

> :warning: **This functionality is currently disabled.**

The hourly run of `check_for_translation_updates` looks to see if any of the
translation files in Transifex have newer last modification times than we know
about. It performs the following process (which can also be done manually:

1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above, is in place
2. Within the [creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata] (the [Data
   Repository](#data-repository)):
   1. Checkout or create the appropriate branch.
      - For example, if a French translation file for BY 4.0 has changed, the
        branch name will be `cc4-fr`.
   2. Download the updated `.po` file from Transifex
   3. Do the [Translation Update Process](#translation-update-process) (below)
      - *This is important and easy to forget,* but without it, Django will
        keep using the old translations
   4. Commit that change and push it upstream.
3. Within this `cc-licenses` repository:
   1. For each branch that has been updated, [Generate Static
      Files](#generate-static-files) (below). Use the options to update git and
      push the changes.

[repodata]:https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-licenses-data


### Check for Translation Updates Dependency Documentation

- [GitPython Documentation — GitPython 3.1.18 documentation][gitpythondocs]
- [Requests: HTTP for Humans™ — Requests 2.26.0 documentation][requestsdocs]

[gitpythondocs]: https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html
[requestsdocs]: https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/


### Translation Update Process

This Django Admin command must be run any time the `.po` files are created or
changed.

1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above,  is in place
2. Ensure [Docker Compose Setup](#docker-compose-setup), above,  is complete
3. Compile translation messages (update `.mo` files)
    ```
    docker-compose exec app ./manage.py compilemessages
    ```


## Generate Static Files

Generating static files updates the static files in the `doc` directory of the
[creativecommons/cc-licenses-data][repodata] repository (the [Data
Repository](#data-repository), above).


### Static Files Process

This process will write the HTML files in the cc-licenses-data clone directory
under `docs/`. It will not commit the changes (`--nogit`) and will not push any
commits (`--nopush` is implied by `--nogit`).

1. Ensure the [Data Repository](#data-repository), above,  is in place
2. Ensure [Docker Compose Setup](#docker-compose-setup), above,  is complete
3. Compile translation messages (update `.mo` files)
    ```
    docker-compose exec app ./manage.py publish --nogit --branch=main
    ```


### Publishing changes to git repo

When the site is deployed, to enable pushing and pulling the licenses data repo
with GitHub, create an ssh deploy key for the cc-licenses-data repo with write
permissions, and put the private key file (not password protected) somewhere
safe (owned by `www-data` if on a server), and readable only by its owner
(0o400). Then in settings, make `TRANSLATION_REPOSITORY_DEPLOY_KEY` be the full
path to that deploy key file.
